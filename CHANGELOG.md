## [0.1.6] - 2018-1-12

### Fixed
- Now caching CV indices. When CV generators are passed with `shuffle=True` and
  no `random_state` is set, they produce different CV folds on each call to
  `split` (#22).
- Updated `scipy` dependency in `requirements.txt` file to `scipy>=0.14,<2.0`
- ``DataFrameETL`` now correctly handles all ``Categorial``-type columns
  in input ``DataFrame``s. The fix also improves execution time of
  ``transform`` calls by 2-3x (#20).
